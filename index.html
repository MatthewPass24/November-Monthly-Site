                  Abraham Lincoln faced numerous challenges throughout his life and career. Here are some of the most significant: Poverty and Hardship: Lincoln was born into poverty and spent much of his childhood doing manual labor on his family's farm. As a young man, he struggled to make ends meet and often had to take on menial jobs to support himself.  Political Opposition: Lincoln faced fierce opposition from his political rivals throughout his career. He was frequently criticized for his views on slavery, states' rights, and other controversial issues, and his opponents often attacked him personally. Unity: Lincoln had to deal with a divided country and faced the ultimate challenge to preserve America's unity. The North and South were divided over slavery and other social issues, but fortunately Lincoln helped the country emerge as a more unified body after Americans plunged into Civil War.
