                  <p class="card-text">Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in a log cabin in Hardin County, Kentucky. His parents, Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln, were farmers who struggled to make ends meet.  Despite the challenges of frontier life, Lincoln showed an early interest in learning, and he taught himself to read and write. He also helped his father with farm work and other chores, developing a strong work ethic that would serve him well in his later years.
